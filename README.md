# LLMTrafficMonitor 
The main goal of this repository is to measure how much Internet traffic is generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) during user interactions. As GenAI tools become widespread, their impact on network load grows.

This repo includes code to estimate traffic per prompt for popular open-source LLMs in 2025. On average, each query-response exchange generates ~7.6 KB of data, comparable to email or web traffic. We argue AI could become the next major driver of Internet traffic.

## Key folders in the repository
| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `R_running_locally/` | R scripts for local LLM traffic testing. Includes a Plumber-based responding agent that connects to LM Studio, and two querying agents: one for interactive input and another that automates queries from a JSONL file. |
| `Querying_Responding_Agents/` | Pythobn scripts for simulating traffic between querying agents and LLM-based responders. Querying agents read test data (e.g. math questions), send HTTP requests, and log traffic size. Responding agents run lightweight HTTP servers (e.g. Flask apps) that interface with specific LLMs like Claude, OpenAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, and others. |
| `packet_capture/` | Jupyter notebook for analyzing network packet sizes during LLM interactions, as well as providing traffic statistics (e.g., average request/response sizes) based on IP and port filters. |
| `data/` | Dataset used for testing, which is a JSON file containing math questions (obtained from [OpenAI](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math/tree/master)). |
